Our work combines two interaction modes, speech and gesture, for multiple device control in Ambient Assisted Living environments.

Important empirical data were collected through the user study, which encouraged further developments on our multimodal interactive system for Ambient Assisted Living environments.', 'docno': 'W12-3504'}\n",

The system is based on two supervised machine learning algorithms: Maximum Entropy and Support Vector Machines. These algorithms were trained on a corpus created from Sem-Cor, Senseval 2 and 3 all words and lexical sample corpora and Open Mind Word Expert 1.0 corpus. We used topical, syntactic and semantic features. Some semantic features were created using WordNet glosses with semantic relations tagged manually and automatically as part of eXtended WordNet project. We also tried to create more training instances from the disambiguated WordNet glosses found in XWN project (XWN, 2003). For words for which we could not build a sense classifier, we used First Sense in WordNet as a back-off strategy in order to have coverage of 100%. The precision and recall of the overall system is 81.446% placing it in the top 5 systems.', 'docno': 'S07-1047'}\n",
      "{'text': \"The {ADELE} Corpus of Dyadic Social Text Conversations:Dialog Act Annotation with {ISO} 24617-2\\n\\n\\n Social or interactional dialog is less well described than task-based or instrumental dialog, although there is increasing interest in the genre, particularly in light of new spoken and text dialog applications which aim to relate to the user as well as perform tasks. Dialog act annotation aids understanding of interaction structure; essential to the design of sucessful artificial dialog. Much social text interaction may be closer to social talk than to traditional written language. In this paper we briefly describe social or casual talk, and review how current dialog annotation schemes and particularly the ISO standard 24617-2 (Semantic annotation framework, Part 2: Dialogue Acts) treat non-task elements of dialog. To aid in training a casual talk system, we collected a corpus of 193 dyadic text dialogs, based on a novel 'getting to know you' social dialog elicitation paradigm. We describe the annotation of the dialogs, and propose additional acts to better cover greeting and leavetaking. We report on preliminary analyses of the corpus, and provide an overview of the corpus content and its relationship to spoken language. The corpus, coding manual, and annotations are being packaged and will be made available to interested researchers.\", 'docno': 'L18-1633'}\n",

Our method is seeded by a small manually segmented Arabic corpus and uses it to bootstrap an unsupervised algorithm to build the Arabic word segmenter from a large unsegmented Arabic corpus. The algorithm uses a trigram language model to determine the most probable morpheme sequence for a given input. The language model is initially estimated from a small manually segmented corpus of about 110,000 words. To improve the segmentation accuracy, we use an unsupervised algorithm for automatically acquiring new stems from a 155 million word unsegmented corpus, and re-estimate the model parameters with the expanded vocabulary and training corpus. The resulting Arabic word segmentation system achieves around 97% exact match accuracy on a test corpus containing 28,449 word tokens. We believe this is a state-of-the-art performance and the algorithm can be used for many highly inflected languages provided that one can create a small manually segmented corpus of the language of interest. 1 Arabic is presented in both native and Buckwalter transliterated Arabic whenever possible. All native Arabic is to be read from right-to-left, and transliterated Arabic is to be read from left-to-right. The convention of\", 'docno': 'P03-1051'}\n",

      "{'text': 'A data-driven approach to verbal multiword expression detection. {PARSEME} Shared Task system description paper\\n\\n\\n Multiword expressions are groups of words acting as a morphologic, syntactic and semantic unit in linguistic analysis. Verbal multiword expressions represent a subgroup of multiword expressions, namely that in which a verb is the syntactic head of the group considered in its canonical (or dictionary) form. All multiword expressions are a great challenge for natural language processing, but the verbal ones are particularly interesting for tasks such as parsing, as the verb is the central element in the syntactic organization of a sentence. In this paper we introduce our data-driven approach to verbal multiword expressions, which was objectively validated during the PARSEME shared task on verbal multiword expressions identification. We tested our approach on 12 languages, and we provide detailed information about corpora composition, feature selection process, validation procedure and performance on all languages.', 'docno': 'W17-1716'}\n",

Such talk is ubiquitous and its structure differs from that found in the task-based interactions that have been the focus of dialogue system design for many years. It is unlikely that such conversations can be modelled as an extension of task-based talk. We review theories of casual conversation, report on our studies of the structure of casual dialogue, and outline challenges we see for the development of spoken dialog systems capable of carrying on casual friendly conversation in addition to performing welldefined tasks.', 'docno': 'W18-5006'}\n",

We propose Sketch-Fill-A-R, a framework that uses a personamemory to generate chit-chat responses in three phases. First, it generates dynamic sketch responses with open slots. Second, it generates candidate responses by filling slots with parts of its stored persona traits. Lastly, it ranks and selects the final response via a language model score. Sketch-Fill-A-R outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline both quantitatively (10-point lower perplexity) and qualitatively (preferred by 55% in head-to-head single-turn studies and 20% higher in consistency in multi-turn user studies) on the Persona-Chat dataset. Finally, we extensively analyze Sketch-Fill-A-R's responses and human feedback, and show it is more consistent and engaging by using more relevant responses and questions. * Work done as an intern at Salesforce Research.\", 'docno': '2020.nlp4convai-1.14'}\n"
